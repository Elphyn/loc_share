What should I start with:
    1. I think first I have to create a server that could recieve files


To make a server that recieves files I need:
    1. Host a node.js server
    2. Learn POST/GET 

It seems that I should've considered Express first, so I am going to install that first
Then I would work out how to use POST/GET and attempt sending files to the server
Also I need to learn how to interact with file system
